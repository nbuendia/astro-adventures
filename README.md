## Introduction

This game is a mash-up of Asteroids and Space Invaders.. _sort of?_ Give it a try! You, the player, are a spaceship wandering space trying to avoid all the meteors and alien spaceships that only seem to damage your spaceship! You can destroy any incoming asteroids and alien ships that get in your way by shooting missiles and rack up as many points as you could before your lives run out!

## Gameplay

Use keyboard **Arrow keys** to move spaceship up, down, right & left.
Use **Space Bar key** to shoot missiles.

when lives run out, game will automaticlly restart after the 3 second countdown.

## Next Steps

**THIS GAME IS STILL A _WORK-IN-PROGRESS_**
Im consistantly looking to improve what I started here. I'd like to add a:

- Menu scene, with:
  - High score section
  - Music on/off section
  - Player character selection _(choice of color spaceship)_.
- Would like to also add some background music and sound effects to make the gameplay more interactive.
- Ultimately I'd like to add levels with different intensities, music/sound effects and background.
